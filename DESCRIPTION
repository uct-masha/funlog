Title: Opinionated Logging Library
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jared Norman
Maintainer: Jared Norman <jared.norman@uct.ac.za>
Description: Uses the rlog library for logging but does a best-effort attempt
    to include information about the location and name of the parent function.
    I have found this useful in cases where R gives an error without sufficient
    context and you want to reason about where the error may have occured.
